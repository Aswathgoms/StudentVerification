# Student Database Verification for Employment

Welcome to the Student Database Verification for Employment project! This web application is designed for registering the data of college students in their final year of any university degree. The project aligns with the vision of digital India, allowing students to digitally register personal details and education-related certificates such as SSLC, HSC, and Degree. Upon registration, each student receives a unique identification number.

## Project Overview

Nowadays, after completing their degrees, students often face challenges carrying physical documents to different states while searching for jobs. This system aims to streamline the employment verification process by providing a digital platform for students to store their education-related documents. The key features include:

- User registration with personal details.
- Storage of education-related certificates (SSLC, HSC, Degree, etc.).
- Assignment of a unique identification number to each registered student.

## Verification Process

- **Placement Officer Verification:**
  - The placement officer can access the system to verify student details.
  - Upon successful verification, the system marks the student as verified.

- **Digital Card Generation:**
  - After verification, the system generates a digital card for each student.
  - This digital card includes verified student details and relevant certificates.
  - Companies can scan the card for background verification within an hour.
